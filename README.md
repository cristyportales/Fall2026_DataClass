# Fall2026_DataClass
Example Repository for class

This repository serves as an example of how you might organize your repository. 
I have included scripts within each folder that outline expectations for each project update.

Generally, ee will create project update expectations together in class. 
I will update the repository to reflect what we agreed on.
