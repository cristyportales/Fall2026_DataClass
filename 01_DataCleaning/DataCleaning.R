##### Data Cleaning #####

## By project update #1, I expect that you:

## 1. have identified data sources and can read them into R
## 2. have identified some of your questions (add them to README file)

## By project update #2, I expect that you:

## 3. use tidyverse or other tools to "clean" data 
## 4. your cleaning script can be sourced 
## 5. when you source your cleaning script, it only produces datasets and functions you need for analysis
